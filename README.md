# Custom meta-dataset

This is a forked version of the meta-dataset repository as of commit `665a265431c2708179d7e0a6bc648a9c82d5ebca`.

## Overview

This repository adapts the code for exporting the datasets to TFRecords using Python 3, since the original version uses Python 2. We recommend to use the README file of commit `665a265431c2708179d7e0a6bc648a9c82d5ebca` to check the usage of the meta-dataset.

## Note

As of our best knowledge, the Python 3 convertion of the original meta-dataset repository has officially been made by the authors in June, therefore we encourage everyone to use [the official repo](https://github.com/google-research/meta-dataset) instead.
